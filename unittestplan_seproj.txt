Unit Test plan:
For testing the code,I have written test cases  for each functions which makes testing modular and easy to rectify errors,
For each functionality I have generated cases for a validInput,Invalidinput and covered edge cases and I have made sure to 
delete the data that I have added after the run in the teardown phase which reduced data update-delete anomaly.

The test cases I have made are:
displayCoursesTest
CourseEditCheckAd
ContactInfoTest
CourseDeletionTestAd
CourseAddCheckAd
CurriculumTestModify
GradeCalculationTest
CourseRegistrationTest
UpdateGradesTest
CurrciulumTestAdd
userTest
gradcheckTest
displaycoursest
displayRegisteredCourses
courseaddcheck
TranscriptorGeneratorTest
DBconnTest
displayCoursesTestad
CourseDeletionTest
RegisterCheckTest
